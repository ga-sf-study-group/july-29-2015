<h2>Problem 1</h2>
<p>Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you can not use additional data structures?</p>

<h2>Problem 2</h2>
<p>Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional buffer. NOTE: One or two additional variables are fine. An extra copy of the array is not.<br>
FOLLOW UP<br>
Write the test cases for this method.</p>

<h2>Problem 3</h2>
<p>Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not.</p>

<h2>Problem 4</h2>
<p>Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with ‘%20’.</p>

<h2>Problem 5</h2>
<p>Given a dictionary of millions of words, give an algorithm to find the largest possible rectangle of letters such that every row forms a word (reading left to right) and every column forms a word (reading top to bottom).</p>
